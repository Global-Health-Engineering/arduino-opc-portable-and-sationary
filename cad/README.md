# cad

This directory contains 3D CAD models of the monitor housings and components.

## Portable & Stationary

These subdirectories contain 3D-printable housings for the monitors (portable monitor & stationary monitor).

For the bill of materials check the main `README.md` file.

The `.stl` files can be directly imported into the slicing software. They are designed to be printed on an FDM printer using a 0.4 mm nozzle.  
To print the parts, split the mesh into seperate parts.

## misc

This subdirectory contains very basic placeholder models of the components that were used to design a custom enclosure.
