# cad

This directory contains 3D CAD models of the monitor housings and components.

## Portable/Stationary

3D-printable housings for the monitors. For a BOM of the hardware needed check the main README.md file.

Designed to be printed on an FDM printer using a 0.4 mm nozzle. The .stl file can be directly imported into the slicing software. To print the parts, split the mesh into seperate parts.

## misc

Very basic placeholder models of the components that can be used to design a custom enclosure.
