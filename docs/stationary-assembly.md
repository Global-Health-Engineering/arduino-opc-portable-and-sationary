# Assembly of the Stationary Monitor Core

--TODO whole file is one big TODO

The assembly of the stationary is a bit more involved than that of the portable one. The main reason for this is a pin conflict between the Adafruit DLS and the DFRobot SIM shield. Other than this, the process is very similar to that of the portable monitor.
